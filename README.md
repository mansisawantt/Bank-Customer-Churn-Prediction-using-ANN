# Bank Customer Churn Prediction using ANN

This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

---

##  Aim

To build an ANN-based classification model that can accurately predict customer churn in a bank based on demographic and account-related data. This helps the bank take proactive steps to retain high-risk customers.

---

##  Problem Statement

In the competitive banking sector, customer retention is crucial. Identifying customers who are likely to leave the bank (churn) allows timely intervention. The goal of this project is to analyze customer data and build a machine learning model that can predict churn based on historical behavior and attributes such as credit score, age, balance, etc.

---

##  Overview

- Used a dataset of 10,000 customers with features like age, balance, credit score, and more.
- Built a deep learning model using Keras (TensorFlow backend).
- Goal: Predict the `Exited` column (1 = churn, 0 = retained).

##  Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

##  Steps

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Feature scaling
4. Splitting into training and test sets
5. Building and training the ANN model
6. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)

##  Files

- `churn_ann.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code
- `Churn_Modelling.csv`: Dataset used

---

## Results

- **Accuracy**: ~86%
- Used confusion matrix to evaluate true positives and negatives
- The model effectively distinguishes between churned and retained customers

---

##  Conclusion

The ANN model successfully predicts churn with high accuracy. It helps identify high-risk customers early, enabling the bank to take necessary actions such as offering better services, promotions, or personalized follow-ups. This model can be further improved with more features or deployed as a web service for real-time use.
